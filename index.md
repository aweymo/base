Andrew Weymouth is the Digital Initiatives Librarian at University of Idaho. In this position, he focuses on using static web technology to curate the institution’s special collections and partners with faculty and students to create custom fellowship projects. He also develops digital tools and workflows to enhance transcription, tagging, and image processing, making the university’s audio, text, and visual resources more discoverable for researchers. 

Previously, he has created digital scholarship projects for the University of Washington and the Tacoma Northwest Room archives, ranging from long form audio public history to architectural databases and interactive network visualizations. Recent research includes using material history methodologies to reexamine early commercial imagery, as well as using field recording and embodiment techniques to make new connections in environmental history. His recent publications explore the formation of libraries in the American Far West, the history of Filipino Alaskero cannery workers and implementing new digital tools and workflows to text mine and tag oral history collections.
