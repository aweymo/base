Kind of a popcorn fare Ashes and Diamonds. The allegory is blunt and the narration copy feels like it came directly from the US Office of War Information but Tourneur still produces a dynamic portrait of a mangled city inhabited by people from across the world who all just want to go home. 

All of the shots of towering brick building vivisection, crumbling archways and characters scrambling up fields of rubble indicate Frankfurt was the real draw for Tourneur. Avid train lads in the reviews rightfully have their knives out for this naked bait and switch.
