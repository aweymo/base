“Twenty to twenty five minutes out of your whole life and all the ropes that kept you hanging in there get cut loose.”

Pure masculine anxiety dream logic. An environmental psychodrama which points toward America’s age-old destructive trajectory leading up to our current ecological disaster. *toot toot*

Also a perfect car chase movie with rich shot composition, visceral sound design and kinetic editing. Dennis Weaver gives a great, understated performance as a vet unsure of whether he should be angry at a force which is unequivocally trying to eliminate him.
